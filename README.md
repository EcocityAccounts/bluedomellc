# hugo-tourmaline

This is a Hugo theme, forked from the Hugo Lithium theme by Jonathan Rutheiser and Yihui Xie, with modifications to make it work better for teams like `tidyverse.org`. 

This theme is a *work in progress*. This means that the theme will be changing frequently as we rapidly iterate and explore variations in search of the best fit. You are generally best off waiting until the theme is more mature before you use it. We'll update this `README` and the repo status when ready.
